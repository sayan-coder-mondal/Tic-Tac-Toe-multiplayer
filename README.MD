# Multiplayer Tic Tac Toe Online Game Project (April 2025)

I developed this project in April 2025 to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and particularly Socket.IO. In this project, I created a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game webpage.

Features:
1. Proper Tic Tac Toe game environment.
2. Players can create rooms using Socket.IO and connect with other players to play two-player Tic Tac Toe.
3. Players can randomly search for opponents, create rooms, or join using a room code to play.
4. Two players can also play locally on a single device (local multiplayer).
5. As soon as a player leaves the match, the opponent will receive an alert.
6. Responsive design for all screen sizes.
